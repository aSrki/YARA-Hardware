The idea of YARA hardware is for it to be easily changable and possible to build it at home as a DIY project. 
I tried to make as many parts 3D printable as possible, and anyone who tries to do it themselves should need to buy only a few things. 
Even though i added bearing in images of certain assemblies, they are not included in .STEP model of a robot beacuse you should change
them to once available to you in your region. The same idea applies to NEMA stepper motors, and if you have some other NEMA17 you should be able to just plug it in in joints 1-3.
The 4th and 5th joints need to have smaller NEMA motors bacause of the relativelly small form factor of the robot.

Here I will show two main assemblies that where designed in such a way for 3D printing and cost savings. Are they perfect? Well no... but they are good enough keeping in mind that they are basically free.
